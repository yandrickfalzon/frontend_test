# Casino Developer Test

## Task

Build a Symfony MVC application for a casino games list lobby. The application should have well-structured and scalable code, mimicking a real-world project.

## Functionality

1. **Load Games List:**
   - Retrieve the games list from the provided API - https://casino-games-api.united-remote.dev/api-docs/#/default/get_games
   - Implement a mechanism for lazy loading to enhance performance.

2. **Search for a Game:**
   - Add a search feature to allow users to search for games.
   - Ensure the search is responsive and provides relevant results.

3. **View Game Image and Name:**
   - Display the image and name of each game in the list.
   - Implement a user-friendly interface for viewing game details.

## Nice to Haves

- **Lazy Loading:**
  - Utilize lazy loading techniques to optimize the application's performance, especially when loading game details.

- **Docker Containerized App:**
  - Containerize the application using Docker for ease of deployment and consistency across environments.

## Other Requirements

- **Code Structure:**
  - Organize your code in a way that reflects the structure of a large-scale project.
  - Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Follow best practices such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), maintainability, and testability.

- **Additional Features:**
  - Feel free to add any additional features that you believe would enhance the games list experience, such as filters.

## Submission

- Once completed, provide a link to your GitHub repository or send the code via email to <development@united-remote.com>.

This test is designed to evaluate your ability to build a Symfony MVC application with a focus on code structure, functionality, and adherence to best practices. Additionally, the application should demonstrate your ability to interact with a database. Good luck!
